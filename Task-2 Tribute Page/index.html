            <h3>Personal life</h3>
            <p>Vikram Sarabhai was born on 12 August 1919 in a Gujarati Jain family, in Ahmedabad, India. His
                father was Ambalal Sarabhai a major industrialist committed to the Indian independence movement.
                Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini in 1942. The couple had two children. His
                daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist, and his son Kartikeya too became an
                active person in science. He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the <a
                    href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of
                    Cambridge,</a> England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940. In 1945 he returned to
                Cambridge to pursue his PhD and wrote a thesis, "Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes", in
                1947.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Professional life</h3>
            <p>Known as the cradle of space sciences in India, the <a href="https://www.prl.res.in/prl-eng/">Physical
                    Research Laboratory</a> (PRL) was founded in
                1947 by Vikram Sarabhai. PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the "RETREAT", with research on
                cosmic rays.

                The institute was formally established at the M.G. Science Institute, Ahmedabad, on 11 November 1947
                with support from the Karmkshetra Educational Foundation and the Ahmedabad Education Society. Kalpathi
                Ramakrishna Ramanathan was the first Director of the institute. The initial focus was research on cosmic
                rays and the properties of the upper atmosphere. Research areas were expanded to include theoretical
                physics and radio physics later with grants from the Atomic Energy Commission. He led the Sarabhai
                family-owned business conglomerate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai further established the Community Science Centre under the aegis of the Nehru
                Foundation for Development, which was renamed as Vikram A. Sarabhai Community Science Centre. In 1966,
                Dr. Sarabhai was appointed as Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, and Government of India.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With a belief that space technology could play a meaningful role in national development and solving the
                problems of common man, Dr. Vikram A. Sarabhai shaped the Indian Space Programme in 1960. The Indian
                Space programme concentrated on achieving self reliance and developing capability to build and launch
                communication satellites for television broadcast, telecommunications and meteorological applications;
                remote sensing satellites for management of natural resources. Thus Indian Space Programme initiated
                space activities in the country and gradually <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/"> Indian Space Research
                    Organisation</a> (ISRO) came into existence on August 15, 1969.</p>

                applications in particular as “levers of development,” Sarabhai initiated programs to take
                education to remote villages through satellite communication and called for the development of
                satellite-based remote sensing of natural resources.</p>
